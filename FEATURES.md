Step 2: Create a simple Flask app Create a new Python file, let's call it app.py, and add the following code:

from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/daily_challenge', methods=['GET'])
def daily_challenge():
    daily_word = "example"  # Replace with your daily word selection logic
    return jsonify({"daily_word": daily_word})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
This code will create a simple Flask app with a single /daily_challenge route that returns a JSON object containing the daily challenge word.

Step 3: Run your Flask app Navigate to the directory containing your app.py file, and run the following command:


python app.py
By default, the Flask app will start on port 5000. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/daily_challenge to see the response.

Step 4: Integrate the Flask API with your game

In your word game, add a function that retrieves the daily challenge word from your Flask app:


import requests

def get_daily_challenge():
    response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/daily_challenge")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        daily_word = response.json()["daily_word"]
        return daily_word
    else:
        return None
Now, you can call this get_daily_challenge() function in your game to fetch the daily challenge from the server (your Flask app) and use the word accordingly.

Remember, this is a very basic setup meant for local testing, and you'll need to deploy the Flask app to a server to make it accessible to other players. There are numerous hosting services, like Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or a Virtual Private Server (VPS) that allow you to deploy Flask apps easily.
