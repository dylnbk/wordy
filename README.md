# implement splash screen / menu
# fix button aesthetic for consistency
# do a backend for the app?
# if not using backend, add a special word list to find unique daily challenges
# if using a backend, add user profiles, leader board
# use the special word list to add additional game feature such as conundrum or riddle?
# add visual effects to make it more attractive?

# possible bug, if there are two words on the same row/column which one does the game validate? possibly add a check that forces it to check for words starting at the clicked letter
